Steps to run the codes:
-----------------------
1) to process xml file run file :data.py

2) to extract the data from xml file and create tsv file from it run file:extraction.py

3) to execute all the models run the file data_processing.py
  (try to run a single model at a time as it will take some time to train and predict)
